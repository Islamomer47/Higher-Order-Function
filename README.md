# Higher-Order-Function

# Array Operations

This repository contains solutions for various array manipulation tasks using JavaScript. Each task demonstrates different methods of iterating over arrays and manipulating their elements.

## Tasks

### Ex1: Power of Two

**Functionality:**  
Takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array where each element is `2` raised to the power of the original element.

**Methods Used:**

- `for` loop
- `forEach` loop
- `map` method

### Ex2: Even or Odd

**Functionality:**  
Takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each element is either the string "even" or the string "odd", based on each value. If any element is not a number, the resulting array contains "N/A" in its place.

**Method Used:**

- `map` method

### Ex3: Returning Names Using `forEach`

**Functionality:**  
Returns all the names in the given array using the `forEach` loop.

**Method Used:**

- `forEach` loop

### Ex4: FizzBuzz

**Functionality:**  
Takes an array of numbers and returns a new array based on the following rules:

- If a number is divisible by 3, add "Fizz" to the output array.
- If a number is divisible by 5, add "Buzz" to the output array.
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add "Fizz Buzz" to the output array.
- Otherwise, add the number itself to the output array.

**Method Used:**

- `forEach` loop
